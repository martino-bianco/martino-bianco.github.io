    <section id="aboutMe">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        For over two decades, I've been orchestrating culinary delights in
        kitchens, evolving from a seasoned chef to the co-owner and manager of a
        bustling restaurant for nearly 5 years. My journey in the culinary world
        has been a rich tapestry of flavors and experiences, and the art of food
        remains a cherished passion close to my heart.
      </p>

      <h3>From the Kitchen to Code:</h3>

      <p>
        Fuelled by a fascination with technology, I'm embarking on a thrilling
        career transition into the world of programming. The same dedication
        that stirred pots and pans is now channelled into crafting lines of
        code, where precision and creativity intertwine.
      </p>
      <h3>What Drives Me:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="language">Kitchen Wisdom:</span> <br />After two decades
          in the culinary realm, I've developed a knack for turning simple
          ingredients into memorable experiences. Now, that same attention to
          detail comes in handy while writing lines of code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="language">Business & Culinary Fusion:</span><br />
          Running a restaurant wasn't just about cooking; it taught me the ropes
          of managing a business, balancing budgets, and ensuring customers
          leave satisfied.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="language"> Tech Enthusiast:</span> <br />
          I have a deep fascination with technology. Although I'm a classically
          trained pianist, for the past 25 years, I've been working extensively
          with electronic instruments, ranging from classic analog synths to
          modern software instruments and DAWs, embracing the evolution of
          musical technology throughout the years.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Beyond Work:</h3>

      When I'm not working or coding, you'll find me playing music, getting into
      sports, exploring new places and going on adventures with my trusty T4
      California.
      <h3>Connecting Through Languages:</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to my pursuits in culinary arts and programming, I maintain
        a deep-seated passion for linguistics adventures learning new human
        languages. This has not only broadened my horizons but has also allowed
        me to connect with people from various backgrounds on a deeper level.
      </p>
      <h3>What am I currently up to:</h3>
      <p>
        At the moment, my focus is on honing my skills in React and React
        Native, dipping my toes into mobile aplications.
